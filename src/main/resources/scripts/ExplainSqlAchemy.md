Perfect — I’ll walk through the four files you showed (line-by-line), explaining exactly what each line does and how they interact. I’ll keep the code you have on screen and annotate it precisely.

⸻

1) src/schemas.py

from enum import Enum

	•	Imports Python’s built-in Enum type so we can create a finite set of named constants (safe status values instead of free-text).

class WorkflowStatus(Enum):

	•	Declares an enumeration class named WorkflowStatus. Each member is a distinct, hashable constant.

    DRAFT = "DRAFT"
    IN_QUEUE = "IN_QUEUE"
    IN_PROGRESS = "IN_PROGRESS"
    AWAITING_FEEDBACK = "AWAITING_FEEDBACK"
    FAILED = "FAILED"
    COMPLETED = "COMPLETED"

	•	Defines the only valid states a workflow may have.
	•	Each left-hand name (e.g., DRAFT) is an enum member; the right-hand value is the underlying string stored/serialized.

class WorkflowBase(BaseModel):

	•	Declares a Pydantic model that represents the JSON shape you expose via the API (request/response DTO).
	•	Using Pydantic gives field validation, type conversion, and OpenAPI documentation.

    gpn: str

	•	A required string field (e.g., “Global Personnel Number”).

    name: str

	•	A required string field representing a human-readable name.

    email: EmailStr

	•	A required field validated as an email using Pydantic’s EmailStr.

    status: WorkflowStatus

	•	A required field constrained to the WorkflowStatus enum defined above.
	•	When FastAPI returns this, it serializes as the enum’s string value.

⸻

2) src/entities.py (mapper from ORM rows → API DTOs)

def transform_workflows_sql_alchemy_to_response(
    workflows: Sequence[WorkflowSqlAlchemy],
) -> list[WorkflowBase]:

	•	Defines a function that accepts a sequence of ORM row objects (WorkflowSqlAlchemy) and returns a list of API DTOs (WorkflowBase).
	•	Keeping this mapping in one place decouples your DB model from your API schema.

    return [

	•	Starts a list-comprehension to build the response list.

        WorkflowBase(

	•	For each ORM row, construct a WorkflowBase Pydantic object.

            gpn=workflow.created_by_gpn,

	•	Maps DB column/attribute created_by_gpn into the API field gpn.

            name=workflow.created_by_name,

	•	Maps DB attribute to API field name.

            email=workflow.created_by_email,

	•	Maps DB attribute to API field email. Pydantic will validate it as an email.

            status=WorkflowStatus(value=workflow.status),

	•	Converts the stored DB value (likely a string) back to the WorkflowStatus enum.
	•	If the value is not one of the enum’s strings, Pydantic/Enum would raise, preventing bad data from escaping.

        )
        for workflow in workflows,
    ]

	•	Closes the WorkflowBase constructor, iterates over all workflows, and returns the built list.

If your SQLModel flavor uses slightly different attribute names (e.g., w.created_by_email), this function does the same mapping job; only attribute names change.

⸻

3) src/database.py (async engine + session factory + FastAPI dependency)

import os

	•	Use environment variables for configuration (12-factor best practice).

from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import (
    AsyncSession,
    create_async_engine,
    AsyncEngine,
    async_sessionmaker,
)

	•	Imports SQLAlchemy’s async primitives:
	•	create_async_engine builds the async DB engine.
	•	AsyncEngine is the engine type.
	•	async_sessionmaker produces AsyncSession objects.
	•	AsyncSession is the async session you use per request.

DATABASE_URL: str = os.getenv(
    "DATABASE_URL",
    "postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:password@localhost/corp_takeover",
)

	•	Reads the database URL from env var DATABASE_URL, falling back to a local default.
	•	The postgresql+asyncpg:// scheme ensures the async driver asyncpg is used.

engine: AsyncEngine = create_async_engine(url=DATABASE_URL, echo=True)

	•	Creates a process-wide async engine bound to your Postgres.
	•	echo=True logs SQL to stdout (great for debugging; set False in prod).

AsyncSessionLocal: async_sessionmaker[AsyncSession] = async_sessionmaker(
    bind=engine,
    class_=AsyncSession,
    expire_on_commit=False,
)

	•	Constructs a session factory that will create AsyncSession objects bound to engine.
	•	expire_on_commit=False means ORM instances keep their loaded values after commit() (no immediate re-load on attribute access).

async def get_session() -> Generator[AsyncSession, Any, None]:

	•	Declares a FastAPI dependency function that yields an AsyncSession to route handlers.
	•	The return type is a generator because we’ll yield the session (so FastAPI can handle teardown).

    async with AsyncSessionLocal() as session:

	•	Creates a new AsyncSession using the factory, inside an async context manager to guarantee proper close/cleanup.

        yield session

	•	Yields the live session to the route handler.
	•	When the handler finishes, the async with block exits and the session is closed automatically (even on exceptions).

4) src/routers/workflow_sql_alchemy.py (the endpoint)

from collections.abc import Sequence
from typing import Annotated, TypeAlias

	•	Type aids:
	•	Sequence expresses a read-only, ordered collection.
	•	Annotated lets you attach FastAPI Depends(...) metadata to a type.
	•	TypeAlias (PEP 613) turns an expression into a named alias for readability.

from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
from sqlalchemy import select
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession

	•	APIRouter groups endpoints under a common prefix and tag.
	•	Depends is FastAPI’s dependency injection.
	•	select constructs SQL statements in SQLAlchemy Core.
	•	AsyncSession is the async DB session type used in the handler.

from src.database import get_session
from src.entities import WorkflowSqlAlchemy, transform_workflows_sql_alchemy_to_response
from src.schemas import WorkflowBase

	•	Imports your DI provider (get_session), the ORM entity, the transformer function, and the API schema.

router: APIRouter = APIRouter(prefix="/workflows/sql_alchemy", tags=["workflow"])

	•	Creates a router with base path /workflows/sql_alchemy and OpenAPI tag “workflow” (groups these routes in Swagger UI).

sessionDep: TypeAlias = Annotated[AsyncSession, Depends(get_session)]

	•	Defines a neat alias: whenever a parameter is typed as sessionDep, FastAPI will inject an AsyncSession from get_session.
	•	Keeps the function signature concise and self-documenting.

@router.get(path="/", response_model=list[WorkflowBase])

	•	Declares a GET endpoint at /workflows/sql_alchemy/.
	•	response_model tells FastAPI/Pydantic to validate and serialize the response as a list of WorkflowBase items (auto-docs too).

async def list_workflows(session: sessionDep) -> list[WorkflowBase]:

	•	Defines the async route handler.
	•	The session parameter is injected automatically (thanks to the alias).
	•	Return type declared for clarity and editor help.

    result: Result[Tuple[WorkflowSqlAlchemy]] = await session.execute(

	•	Executes an async SQLAlchemy query.
	•	The Result[...] type hint indicates this call returns a SQLAlchemy Result object that can yield ORM rows.

        select(WorkflowSqlAlchemy).order_by(WorkflowSqlAlchemy.created_at.desc())

	•	Builds SELECT * FROM workflow_table ORDER BY created_at DESC.
	•	select(WorkflowSqlAlchemy) selects ORM rows for that mapped class.
	•	order_by(...desc()) sorts newest first.

    )

	•	Ends the await session.execute(...) call.

    workflows: Sequence[WorkflowSqlAlchemy] = result.scalars().all()

	•	result.scalars() unwraps ORM rows to just the entity objects (instead of tuples).
	•	.all() materializes the entire result into a list.

    response: list[WorkflowBase] = transform_workflows_sql_alchemy_to_response(workflows)

	•	Converts ORM entities into API DTOs (WorkflowBase) using your dedicated mapper.

    return response

	•	Returns the validated, serializable list.
	•	FastAPI runs Pydantic validation against response_model=list[WorkflowBase] and sends JSON.

⸻

How the pieces work together (end-to-end)
	1.	Client calls GET /workflows/sql_alchemy/.
	2.	FastAPI builds dependencies:
	•	Calls get_session() → enters async with AsyncSessionLocal().
	•	Injects that AsyncSession into list_workflows(...).
	3.	Handler runs:
	•	Builds and awaits a SELECT query, ordered by created_at DESC.
	•	Extracts the ORM entities via result.scalars().all().
	•	Maps them to WorkflowBase DTOs.
	4.	FastAPI serializes DTOs to JSON (using response_model) and returns 200 OK.
	5.	FastAPI exits the dependency context → session is closed automatically.

⸻

A few precise “why” clarifications
	•	Why AsyncSession and await?
Database I/O is network-bound. Using async sessions + await keeps the event loop free to serve other concurrent requests.
	•	Why scalars()?
session.execute(select(Entity)) by default returns row-tuples. scalars() unwraps rows to the mapped entity instances directly (cleaner).
	•	Why a transformer instead of returning entities?
Separation of concerns: DB models often contain more (or different) fields than the API should return. The mapper is your single truth for that translation.
	•	Why Annotated[..., Depends(...)] and a type alias?
It keeps your handler signatures minimal and consistent. The alias name (sessionDep) makes it obvious that the param is an injected dependency.

⸻

If you want, I can also annotate your SQLModel version side-by-side (same DI pattern, but from sqlmodel import SQLModel, select and await session.exec(...)) and add a tiny create_all bootstrap/seed script so you can run it in isolation.
